# Bangalore Home Price Predictor Project

# Overview
 This project aims to develope a machine learning model for predicting home prices based on input features such as location, no of bedrooms, no of bathrooms, square area feet and surge pricing.

 The project includes data collection, data preprocessing, model development, evaluation Below are the key details and findings of the project:

 ## Dataset 
 * **Source:** Kaggle
 * **Description:** The dataset used in this project contains information about individual Home Price, including features such as location, Area Square feet , number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms and surge pricing.
 
## Data Analysis
* Summary statistics for numerical features were calculated, providing insights into the central tendencies and dispersions of the data.
* Missing value counts for numerical features were examined to assess data completeness.
* Use one hot encoding to change location column into numbers

## Machine Learning 
* A machine learning model, specifically a regression model, was developed to predict bangalore home prices based on the dataset.
* Model evaluation metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared score, were used to assess the model's performance.

## Deployment 
* The trained model was deployed on python Flask server, allowing users by using  with the model through a user-friendly mobile application.
* Users can input Home-related information, and the model will provide an estimated price in real-time.
